# Android Messages Desktop

### This project is retired. It has major security and usability issues that I do not have the time or energy to fix. I am also in the process of un-Googling my life and I now use a different SMS app, so this project is not useful to me anymore. Anyone is welcome to fork it and continue development.

This is an Electron application that wraps the Android Messages Web client for use on the desktop. Unlike [nparsons08's project](https://github.com/nparsons08/android-messages), this repository will provide pre-built packages for all three major platforms.

In addition, it also has:
* Custom CSS injection along with Glasstron, allowing you to make it look how you want it to.
* Tray icon for displaying notifications even when the main window is closed.
